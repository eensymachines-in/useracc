### UserAcc as library 
----

```sh 
go get -u github.com/eensymachines.in/useracc
```

Will get you the __latest__ source for useracc library. This captures all the business logic for operating on `Eensymachines` useraccounts. A device on the ground refers to the user accoutn in the cloud. 

User registers an account with `Eensymachines` prior to the purchase of the device , or atleast before the device is commissioned into service.

This library does not provide any covering endpoint but is more aimed at providing the useraccount as a lirabry framework.
